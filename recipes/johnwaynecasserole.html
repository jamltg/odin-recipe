    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The John Wayne casserole is a hearty and satisfying dish that's sure to please everyone at your table. 
        Despite the name, the John Wayne Casserole wasn't popularized by the actor himself, 
        but by a fundraiser cookbook "Cooking with Love from Cara and Her Friends" and the University of Mississippi Medical 
        Center. Read all about this casserole's interesting history in our article, What Is a John Wayne Casserole?</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Biscuits: This convenient dinner starts with a can of refrigerated biscuits.</li>
        <li>Beef: You'll need a pound of ground beef for this meaty casserole.</li>
        <li>Vegetables: Sliced onions and bell peppers are sautéed together, while sliced tomatoes are layered with the other ingredients. 
            Jarred jalapeños, meanwhile, spice things up a bit.</li>
        <li>Cheese: Because isn't everything better with shredded Cheddar cheese? You could use shredded Pepper Jack if you like a little extra heat.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Step 1</p>
            <p>Make the crust: Press the biscuit dough in the bottom and up the sides of a prepared baking dish. 
                Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Step 2</p>
            <p>Cook the meat: Cook the beef until crumbly. Drain the fat, stir in seasoning and water, and bring to a boil. 
                Reduce the heat and simmer. Transfer the meat to a bowl.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Step 3</p>

        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Step 4</p>
            <p>Make the creamy layer: Combine the sour cream, mayo, 1/2 of the Cheddar, and 1/2 of the cooked veggies in a bowl.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Step 5</p>
            <p>Layer and bake the casserole: Layer the meat, tomatoes, onion-pepper mixture, jalapeños, 
                and sour cream mixture on top of the biscuit dough. Sprinkle it with cheese.
